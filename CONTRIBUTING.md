# Contributing to The Sprawl

So you want to hack the Grid? Good. We need operators like you.

## Protocol
1.  **Fork** the Construct.
2.  **Branch** off `main` (`feature/new-protocol`).
3.  **Commit** with precision.
4.  **Push** to the origin.
5.  **Open a Pull Request**.

## Architecture Standards
- **Zero Dependencies**: Do not bring heavy frameworks into the Core.
- **Loose Coupling**: Your module must survive if the others are offline.
- **Tone**: Maintain the aesthetic. Cyberpunk. Professional.
