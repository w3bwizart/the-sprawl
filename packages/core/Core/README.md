# Core Directory

## Goal
The `Core/` directory serves as the "Universal Brain" for the agent. It contains resources that are always active across all hubs, ensuring a baseline of capability, safety, and consistency for every interaction.

## What to Place Here
- **Rules**: Immutable directives that apply to every agent instance.
- **Skills**: "Molecules" or fundamental capabilities that the agent can trigger autonomously.
- **Workflows**: "Organisms" or user-triggered Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

## Examples of Tasks & Processes

1.  **Content Maintainer**: Update `Core/rules/GEMINI.md` to enforce a new policy for "inclusive language".
2.  **PMO Head**: Deploy a `Core/workflows/status-check.md` so every project manager can run `/status` to get a standardized report.
3.  **Finance Director**: Add a `Core/skills/currency-convert/` skill so the agent can always handle multi-currency queries.
4.  **Sales Lead**: Request a `Core/rules/branding.md` update to ensure the agent uses the correct trademarked names.
5.  **SysAdmin**: Add `Core/workflows/onboard-user.md` to standardize how new employees are introduced to the agent.
6.  **Legal Team**: Implement `Core/rules/confidentiality.md` to prevent the agent from outputting PII.
7.  **Marketing Manager**: Update `Core/skills/create-pptx/templates/master.pptx` to push the new Q1 design theme.
8.  **Developer**: specific `Core/skills/format-code.md` to ensure all Python code generated by the agent follows PEP-8.
9.  **HR Manager**: create `Core/workflows/policy-faq.md` allowing any user to ask `/policy vacation` and get the official handbook answer.
10. **Operations**: Add `Core/Scripts/optimize-images.sh` as a utility skill to auto-compress images uploaded to any hub.
