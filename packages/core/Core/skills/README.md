# Core Skills Directory

## Goal
The `Core/skills/` directory contains "Molecules" - modular capabilities that extend the agent's toolset. These are agent-triggered tools or prompt-based skills that provide specific functionality available in any context.

## What to Place Here
- **Skill Folders**: containing `SKILL.md` (metadata) and executable code.
- **Prompt Skills**: Single `.md` files that teach the agent a specific cognitive technique.
