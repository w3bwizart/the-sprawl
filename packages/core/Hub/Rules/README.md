# Hub Rules Directory

## Goal
The `Hub/Rules/` directory defines **Domain Personas**. These are specialized role definitions that shape the agent's behavior for specific business functions. Unlike Core rules, these are not universal; they are role-based.

## What to Place Here
- Markdown files defining specific job roles or personas.
- Files named by role (e.g., `senior-sdr.md`, `project-manager.md`).

## Examples of Tasks & Processes

1.  **Finance Director**: Update `Hub/Rules/finance-auditor.md` to emphasize "Risk Aversion".
2.  **Sales Leader**: Create `Hub/Rules/senior-sdr.md` instructing the agent to be "Persuasive".
3.  **PMO Head**: Modify `Hub/Rules/project-manager.md` to focus on "Deadline Adherence".
4.  **CTO**: Add `Hub/Rules/senior-architect.md` for the Engineering Hub, prioritizing "Scalability".
