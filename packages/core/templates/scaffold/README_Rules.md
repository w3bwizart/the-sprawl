# Rules Protocol // {{HUB_NAME}}

This sector contains the **Personas** and **Guardrails** specific to this Hub.

## Usage
- **Personas**: Define *who* the agent is (e.g., `expert-marketer.md`, `senior-dev.md`).
- **Guardrails**: Define strict "Do Not" rules (e.g., `no-deployment-friday.md`).

## Format
Files should be standard Markdown. Agents read these to understand their role.
