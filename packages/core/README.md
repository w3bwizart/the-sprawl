# Package: CORE

> *Information is the currency of the Sprawl.*

## 💾 Overview
**CORE** is the immutable truth source for The Sprawl. It contains the DNA of every agent deployed on the grid. It is purely declarative—Markdown, JSON, and Text.

**It contains NO executable code.**

## 🗄️ Structure

### `/rules`
The inviolable laws that govern agent behavior.
- **`GEMINI.md`**: The Prime Directive. Safety, Tone, and Stack constraints.

### `/templates`
The blueprints for new constructs.
- **`personas/`**: Standardized personality encodings (e.g., `solutions-architect.md`).
- **`workflows/`**: Operational Procedures (SOPs).
- **`project-structures/`**: Directory scaffold maps.

## 🔗 Integration
The **CLI** pulls these artifacts during workspace initialization.
The **Extension** references these to validate local compliance.
